# Java Tutorial
This tutorial is meant to learn Java for beginners as well as advanced developers.
## Inheritance
Inheritance can be learned by running the Test class inside inheritance, you could change and play with the variables and methods to get a better understanding.

Things discussed:

 - Inheritance in general.
 - Implementing interfaces
 - What happens when a class implements directly/indirectly 2 interfaces with same default method?
 - What is the order of constructors being called?
 - How are the static variables affected throughout the runtime.
 - Will a static variable in parent value be changed if a new object of the child is created?
 - If a same static method exists in an parent class and parent interface, which one would be called if we call that method using child's object?
 - Can variables be inherited?
 - What is static method shadowing?
